running pymol in this direcoty opens the "this folder" pymol settings file (.pymolrc)

This loads in the takeMugshot feature I've written in python (takeMugshot.py)

The my quick and dirty hack is to dump a list of all the .pdb files and just have "takeMugshot [filename]"
This is "mugshot_full_proteome.pml" and after pymol boots up with takeMugshot loaded you hit @mugshot_full_proteome.pml from the Pymol command
