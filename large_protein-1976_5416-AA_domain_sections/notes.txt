DON'T BOTHER WITH ANY OF PYTHON/BASH SCRIPTING. foldseek has an alternative alignments (--alt-ali) flag

Use format mode 3 for the .html report. Pick number of aligments


 foldseek easy-search --alt-ali [suspected_num_repeats] --format-mode 3 [domain].pdb [full_protein].pdb [alignment_name].html tmp

e.g. 
 foldseek easy-search --alt-ali 50 --format-mode 3 Loki_titin-like_domain_1.pdb Loki_ORF1976_AF3_titin-like_one-chain.pdb aln.html tmp`

Making titin file a single chain.

The pymol suggestion causes the 2nd chaing to go haywire, the below -doesn't work-

alter chain B, chain='A'

I dumped as a .cif, find replace B to A in the chain, then obabel file.cif -O file.pdb. Then I had to add the offset of chain A (+4896) to all chain B residues

My awful vim way to do this is type '4986' and then hit cntrl+A to add that to current number. Use a macro to track moved and then many@macro

See below for 3 setting for 1, 2, 3 digit numbers:
  c  "a   4896^Ajkhhhhhhxxxlllj                                                                                                                                                                   
  c  "b   4896^Ajkhhhhhxxlllj                                                                                                                                                                     
  c  "c   4896^Ahhhhxlllj

Selecting the domains

I did this by eye, walked along the chain and higlighted domains I thought were distinct. Copied to a new object. 
Then align obj0X, obj01 so that I could see any overlay.
If they looked possibly distinct I saved to a new .cif -> .pdb. First past by eye gave maybe 6 different domains but many may be similar?
